    <h3>Ingredients for 2 servings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounces) beef sirloin steak</li>
        <li>Half a cup of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of coconut oil</li>
        <li>4 cups of beef broth/li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of miso paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounces) packages ramen noodles</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Step by step guide:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. For best flavor results, marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours. </li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. </li>
        <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top. </li>
    </ol>
