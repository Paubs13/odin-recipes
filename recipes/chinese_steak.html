         <li class="ingredient_item">2 tablespoons of cornstarch</li>
         <li class="ingredient_item">Half a teaspoon of ground ginger</li>
         <li class="ingredient_item">3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>

         <li class="ingredient_item">1 green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares</li>

      <ol class="steps">
         <li>Slice steak into 1/2-inch thick slices across the grain.</li>
         <li>Whisk together soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Place steak slices into the marinade, and stir until well-coated.</li>
         <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook steak strips in batches in hot oil so as not to crowd the pan. Cook and stir until well-browned, about 3 minutes, and remove steak from the wok to a bowl. Repeat with remaining steak, adding more oil as needed, and set the cooked meat aside.</li>
         <li>Return cooked steak strips to the hot wok, and stir in onion. Toss steak and onion together until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes, then stir in green pepper.</li>
         <li>Cook and stir the mixture until peppers have turned bright green and started to become tender, about 2 minutes more, then add tomatoes.</li>
         <li>Stir everything together to mix and blend flavors, and serve.</li>
      </ol>
